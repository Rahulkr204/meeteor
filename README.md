# Meeteor ⚡️ (WIP)

Chrome extension for Google Meet, create meeting using keyboard.

## Description
When you can have multiple impromp-tu meetings in a day and you
want to create meetings on the fly, going through official process takes about 15-20s to join a meeting and have a shareable link. With Meeteor, you can cut down that to 3-5s.


## Install

1. Run `npm install` in the folder to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server (auto refreshes your extension on change)
3. Run `npm run build` to create a production ready build
4. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your browser
5. Ensure `Developer mode` is `enabled` (top right)
6. Click `Load unpacked` in the top left
7. Select the `/build` folder in this directory

This extension triggers a popup page. You simply click the extension icon in the top right or press `Ctrl+Shift+M` to toggle the page popup.
